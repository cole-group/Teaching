Don't worry at this stage about the details, but just note that you can probably already see what the python code is doing. On the other hand, we have to put in a lot of effort with C explicitly setting up and defining the task."

    "Python is **free**, you should be able to install everything we meet here on your own computers/laptops/tablets. Coding in python is generally faster, and easier to learn and code (less likely to introduce **bugs**, though we will meet plenty later in the course). On the other hand, the speed of running a Python code is not usually as high as some other languages (e.g. C, Fortran), but that won't be an issue here.\n",

    "\n",
    "Python can be downloaded from [here](https://www.python.org) and installed on all operating systems. You might find the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) distribution more useful as it comes with all of the libraries that you might need (see later). **Note on running from command line??

    "[Jupyter](http://jupyter4edu.github.io/jupyter-edu-book/) is an interactive notebook that can be accessed via a web browser. It allows us to mix code, visualisation and explanatory text; it is therefore more interactive than a textbook, and more easy to follow than 100's of lines of code. It is not just used for education, it is increasingly used to share research data and ensure it is *reproducible* (anyone should be able to download a Jupyter notebook acoompanying a piece of research, and reproduce the data).\n",
    "\n",
    "You can (and should) save your work as you go, using the menu at the top: `File > Save as...`. Save your copy of this Jupyter notebook to your H:/.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also download your notebook in a range of formats. HTML is probably the most useful for us: `File > Download as > HTML (.html)`. This can be opened later in a web browser, though note that you will lose the interactive element.\n",
