    "\n",
    "What is a computer program? A program is a set of instructions that tell the computer what to do. It can be viewed as an interface between the human (computer programmer) and the computer's machine code. Examples include:\n",
    "* Word processors (e.g. Word);\n",
    "* Web browsers (e.g. Chrome);\n",
    "* Operating systems (e.g. MacOS, Windows);\n",
    "* Video games (e.g. Tetris, Fortnite);\n",
    "* Scientific software, which you will meet during your studies.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, here is the [Apollo 11 guidance source code](https://github.com/chrislgarry/Apollo-11) that landed humans on the moon. Just as humans use many different languages for communication, there also many different *programming languages* that we can use to communicate with the computer. The programming language that we will be using in this module is called *python*.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Further Reading\n",
    "\n",
    "The course textbook for this module is Learning Scientific Programming with Python, Christian Hill (Cambridge University Press), which is available online from the University library [here](https://app.knovel.com/web/toc.v/cid:kpLSPP0001/viewerType:toc/). You can also access the textbook through the course reading list on Canvas. I will highlight relevant chapters each week. I will also supply further web links as we go along, but an important skill for a programmer is to be able to find the answer to a problem online. Python is so widely used that I guarantee that the answer is out there. Just enter \"Python\" plus whatever concept you would like to read more about into a search engine."

    "Python is a high-level programming language, with an expressive, relatively intuitive syntax. Compare below the two programs for printing a list of names, the first in python and the second in C (another programming language). Don't worry at this stage about the details, but just note that you can probably already see what the python code is doing. On the other hand, we have to put in a lot of effort with C explicitly setting up and defining the task."

    "Python is **free**, you should be able to install everything we meet here on your own computers/laptops/tablets (see the induction materials for instructions). Coding in python is generally faster, and easier to learn and code (less likely to introduce **bugs**, though we will meet plenty later in the course). On the other hand, the speed of running a Python code is not usually as high as some other languages (e.g. C, Fortran), but that won't be an issue here.\n",

Python can be downloaded from [here](https://www.python.org) and installed on all operating systems. You might find the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) distribution more useful as it comes with all of the libraries that you might need (see later). You might also come across the term *Integrated Development Environment (IDE)*, which is a tool that allows you to write, edit, test and debug code. IDLE and PyCharm are examples, though we won't be using them here.\n",

    "#### The Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "[Jupyter](http://jupyter4edu.github.io/jupyter-edu-book/) is an interactive notebook (such as this one) that can be accessed via a web browser. It allows us to mix code, visualisation and explanatory text; it is therefore more interactive than a textbook, and more easy to follow than 100's of lines of code. It is not just used for education, it is increasingly used to share research data and ensure it is *reproducible* (anyone should be able to download a Jupyter notebook acoompanying a piece of research, and reproduce the data).\n",
    "\n",
    "You can (and should) save your work as you go, using the menu at the top: `File > Save and Checkpoint`. This should save your own modified version of this Notebook to your OneDrive (if using the WVD) or your own computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also download your notebook in a range of formats. HTML is probably the most useful for us: `File > Download as > HTML (.html)`. This can be opened later in a web browser, though note that you will lose the interactive element.\n",
    "\n",
    "See Appendix A at the bottom of this Workshop for more information on entering text and code into the Jupyter notebook."
