    "\n",
    "RDKit is an [open source](https://github.com/rdkit/rdkit) cheminformatics toolkit. Cheminformatics is a broad term covering the curation and analysis of chemical data. It is perhaps most widely used in drug discovery, where Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationships (QSAR) aim to predict the effectiveness of a potential drug from its structure (e.g. by compring it to known drugs). But similar methods can also be applied to discovering new e.g. organic electronics materials.\n",
    "\n",
    "RDKit is written in the C++ language, but as we'll see most of the functionality is useable through a Python interface. It includes a collection of functionality for molecule input/output in various standard formats, as well as coordinate generation, and molecular analysis.\n",
