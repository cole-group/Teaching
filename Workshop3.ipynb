    "We saw at the end of last week that we can use `for` loops to perform repetitive operations very efficiently. Usually we will not need (or want) to perform every operation in our code on every piece of data. An important concept is the use of *conditional statements* that are used to control the flow of operations in a program. In Python, these usually use the `if...elif...else` construction (`elif` is shorthand for `else if`), and the *comparison operators* that we met in week 1:"
